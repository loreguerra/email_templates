    <h2>    Hi *|FNAME|*, </h2>
<p>Earlier this year we launched our first handheld O<sub>2</sub>/CO<sub>2</sub> gas analyzer—the F-920 Check It! Gas Analyzer, and thanks to you, it’s been a great experience.</p>

<p>Over the past six months you’ve shared important information with us about who you are, how you work, and what you need out of a gas analyzer. Want to know what we heard the most?</p>
<br>

<p><strong>You need something more affordable.</strong></p>
<br>
<br>
<p>So, here’s what we’re going to do about that:</p>
	<callout>
        <p>In 2017 <span class="teal">we’re lowering the price of the F-920 to $2600</span> (that’s $1350 less than our original price of $3950!).</p>
</callout>
<br>
<p>To thank you for the valuable feedback you’ve shared with us, <strong>we’re letting you in the 2017 price early and throwing in a free 2-year warranty on all orders placed before December 31, 2016</strong>.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Ready to jump on this great deal?</p>
<p>Email our super sales administrator, Beth Skiles, at bskiles@felixinstruments.com and she’ll send you a quote with the new price today.
