          There was a time in human history when the only way to enjoy fresh fruit was to pick it right off of the tree and eat it. That meant that a person could only consume fruit that could grow in his or her climate. Now, thanks to the fresh produce supply chain, we get to enjoy all kinds of fruit no matter where we live, even exotic varieties like mango, which can only grow in tropical regions like Australia or South America. </p>
