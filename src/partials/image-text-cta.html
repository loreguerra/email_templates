      <h2>Studying Plants to Predict Climate Change</h2>
        <p>
           “I first became interested in climate change when I was really young, when I learned that humans were the cause of global warming. I wanted to do something with my life that would, in some small way, perhaps counteract this great presumption—who are we to change the climate of the entire planet?”
