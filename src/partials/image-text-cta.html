        <p>We all know that Earth’s population is growing. But do you know how fast? <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/02/03/10-projections-for-the-global-population-in-2050/">According to the Pew Research Center we’ll go from 7 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050.</a> That means we’re going to have a lot of extra mouths to feed.<p>

          <br>

        <p> So how are we going to adapt? Likely it’s going to be a group effort. One thing we know for sure, though, is that agricultural operations of all shapes and sizes are going to be a critical part of the equation.</p>

        <br>

        <p>  Which got us thinking:</p>
        <p><strong>is there anything we can do to help?</strong></p>

        <br>

          <p>Our minirhizotron systems enable agricultural researchers to:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Capture non-destructive, high resolution, digital images to observe the development and function of a plant’s root system.</li>
        <li>Analyze root images to learn important information about the root health and development of their crops.</li>
        <li>Track established and newly rooted crops throughout the growing season non-destructively.</li>
        <li>Diagnose plant pathogens and disorders by acting as an early detection system.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <br>

      <p>If you’re an agronomist with a focus on root research, or are interested in starting to get to know the underground half of your crop, you might be a great fit for our ag grant program. Ready to find out if you qualify?</p>
